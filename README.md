Car Sales Advertisement Visualization

This project is a tool to visualize car sales advertisement data. It utilizes Streamlit for creating interactive web applications, Pandas for data manipulation, and Plotly Express for generating visualizations.

## Description

The tool reads data from a CSV file named "vehicles_us.csv", which contains information about car sales advertisements. It then provides interactive visualizations to analyze this data. Users can select different columns to plot against price, choose the type of plot (scatter plot or histogram), and specify color groups for better analysis.

## Libraries Used

- **Streamlit**: Used for building interactive web applications with Python.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly Express**: Used for creating interactive visualizations.

## Launching the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the project files to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**: Ensure you have a CSV file named "vehicles_us.csv" containing the required data. You may use your own dataset or obtain it from a reliable source.

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the Python script containing the Streamlit application.

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Interact with the Application**: Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser. Select different options to visualize and analyze the car sales advertisement data.

6. **Explore Data**: Utilize the various options provided by the application to explore and analyze the car sales advertisement data effectively.

By following these steps, you should be able to launch the project on your local machine and explore the interactive visualization tool for car sales advertisement data.
